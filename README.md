Event Organizer App

Event Organizer App is an app that lets you keep track of all the events you want to organize in your life.

Creating a profile by signing up and logging in to the app allows you to keep track of your personal events.

You can add new events and make changes to your existing ones. You can even see what others have added to their lists to get inspiration for yours!

Event Organizer App was created for the Flatiron School's Online Web Development Program using Sinatra.

For more information on how to use the app, see my video walkthrough!


Also checkout my blog on the process and completing this portfolio project!
